## Development Process

-   Initialized project with Vite + React + Tailwind CSS v4
-   Implemented three theme system with HSL color values
-   Built responsive grid layout for calculator buttons
-   Added smooth animations and button press effects
-   Implemented complete calculator logic with custom hooks
-   Optimized for GitHub Pages deployment

## Challenges and Solutions

### Theme Switching System

**Problem**: Managing three different color schemes dynamically.  
**Solution**: Created a themes object with HSL values and dynamic style application.

### Responsive Design

**Problem**: Making calculator work on both mobile (375px) and desktop (1440px+).  
**Solution**: Used Tailwind's responsive utilities and flexbox+grid centering.

### Button Animations

**Problem**: Creating satisfying button press effects.  
**Solution**: Implemented mouse event handlers with transform and border animations.

### Number Formatting

**Problem**: Large numbers becoming hard to read.  
**Solution**: Added comma formatting for numbers over 3 digits.

### Tailwind CSS v4 Integration

**Problem**: Using the new Tailwind CSS v4 syntax and configuration.  
**Solution**: Configured @import and @theme directives properly in CSS.

## Future Improvements

-   Add keyboard support for number input
-   Implement scientific calculator mode
-   Add calculation history feature
-   Enable custom theme creation
-   Add sound effects for button presses
-   Implement memory functions (M+, M-, MR, MC)
-   Add copy-to-clipboard functionality
